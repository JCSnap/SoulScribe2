5. Shop: buy characters and pets to customize home page. When you click on an art style, you can see the example arts created and the events associated with them.

7. How long will recap take to generate? Around 20 seconds.
8. Coins: You earn 1 coin per entry, with an increment of 2 coin for every consecutive days journalled up to a maximum of 10, and then 10 throughout. There is no other way to earn coins.
