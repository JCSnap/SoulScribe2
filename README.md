# SoulScribe

SoulScribe is a gamified AI-powered journaling app done under the National University of Singapore (NUS)'s Orbital program. Think Spotify Recap, but instead of recapping your music journey, this app aims to recap your life journey based on your journal entries. This is made possible by leveraging on text-to-text and text-to-image generative AI.

## Main Feature

### Create Weekly Recap

At the end of every week, the system would automatically generate the summary of your week and create an art based on the highlight of your week. Look at the [documentation](#documentation) for a sense of how it looks like.

### Query Your Past

Ask questions about your past. Think chatGPT but with access to all your journal entries.

### Gamification

Earn coins by journaling and doing it consistently. Coins can then be used to buy collectibles (to customize home page), or art styles (to generate your recaps).
